## Overview
The Nemoon Design System was created to ensure consistent spacing in digital design. 
Inspired by high-tech architecture, it integrates visible spacing into each component, 
streamlining the design process.

## Problem and Solution
Designers often struggle with deciding the right spacing between elements, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
Nemoon uses predefined, visible spacing for each component, eliminating the need for designers to make spacing decisions. 
This approach ensures consistency and efficiency.

## Implementation
Nemoon assigns specific spacing to each component, ensuring clear visual hierarchy, consistency, and rhythm. 
Designers can choose to leave the spacing visible as a stylistic choice or hide it once the design is complete.
Nemoon reduced the time spent on spacing decisions and ensured consistent visual style across all designs, 
improving the overall user experience.

Nemoon continues to evolve, incorporating user feedback and adapting to new design trends. 
It blends architectural principles with digital design, providing a practical solution to common design challenges.
